                <h1>Religion in the Roman Empire</h1>
            
                <p>	The Romans were very religious people, and celebrated their religion beliefs, by holding many festivals in honor of their gods. Since the empire’s huge sized and diverse population, the nature of these festivals varied widely from place to place. The Romans were very practical people, and this practicality also extended into their lives. According to page 380, of the textbook, the text states, “The Romans didn’t think that they could be sure which gods did or did not exist.” In order to avoid any gods that were fake or did not exist, the Romans prayed to a wide range of gods and goddesses. A lot of the most popular gods in the Roman Empire were adopted from the conquered people by the Romans. Since the Romans liked the ideas about their religion the Romans, allowed people they conquered to keep their beliefs.
	According to page 381, the text states, “Roman leaders considered Judaism to be a potential problem for two reasons. One reason was religious, the other political. Both reason led to conflict between the Romans and the Jews of the empire.” The Jews did not worship many gods like the Romans, they believed that their God was the only god. Some of the Romans thought that the Jews were insulting or threatening Rome’s gods by not praising them, or praying to them. The Romans still let the Jews to keep their religion and still didn’t ban them. 
	A political conflict rose and started when the Jews rebelled against the Roman rule. Since this happened, Judea, the territory of where most the Jews  lived, was conquered by Rome in 63 BC. The Jews were very unhappy with the Roman rule. They wanted to be ruled with only Jews, not by outsiders. The resulted, with the Jews rebelling in the AD 60s. The rebellion was defeated and it failed, for this the Jews had been punished as well. The the early 100s the Jews rebelled once more against the Romans. According to page 382, the text states, “Tired of putting down Jewish revolts, the emperor Hadrian banned the practice of certain Jewish rituals.” Hadrian thought that this would put down the Jews, although he was mistaken. What he did was make the Jews even more angry, and one last time the Jews revolted again. Although, this time emperor Hadrian decided to end the rebellions in Jerusalem once and for all. The Romans army crushed the Jewish’ revolt, destroyed the Jewish capital of Jerusalem, and forced all Jews to leave the city. The emperor banned them from entering the city again, and the Jews moved into other parts of the world.</p>

                <h1>Origins of Christianity</h1>
            
                <p>Jesus of Nazareth, the man whom many people believe was the Jewish Messiah. He lived at the beginning of the first century AD. Most of what we know about Jesus is all contained and kept in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The Christian Bible is made of two parts. The Old Testament, and the New Testament. Jesus was born if a small town called Bethlehem. Jesus’s birth is what changed BC to AD. Jesus’s mother, Mary, was married to a carpenter named Joseph. Although Christians believed in God, being Jesus’s father. By the time Jesus became 30, from years of studying, Jesus had begun to travel and teach. Stories he told and his actions from this time make up the beginning of the New Testament. Jesus drew many followers with his ideas. Although, at the same time people were challenging the authority of political and religious leaders. According to what the Bible states, Roman authorities arrested Jesus while he was in Jerusalem in or around AD 30. 
	Shortly after his arrest, Jesus was tried and executed. Jesus was forced to carry a cross to the top of a hill, and at the top Jesus was hung and nailed by his hands and feet. He was crucified, and hung on the cross that he dragged up the hill. After his death, he was buried in a tomb. There were two guards who rolled a huge stone to block the opening of the tomb. Then, three days later Jesus vanished from the tomb after an angel came, and scared the guards away, and rolled away the stone. Once the stone was rolled away Jesus was gone, and he has Resurrected. This was the story of Jesus’s resurrection. Soon Jesus appeared to several groups of his disciples. Jesus stayed with these disciples, for the next 40 days, and 40 nights, teaching and giving them instructions about how to pass on his teachings. Then Jesus rose up into heaven.
	According to the Bible, not only did Jesus teach his disciples, but many of them had performed many miracles. Although, it wasn’t the disciples themselves who performed the miracles, but they prayed to God, or Jesus to cast down miracles, and make them happen. There is one story when Jesus fed 5,000 people, with just 5 fish, and 2 loaves of bread. What he did is take a boy’s meal, and duplicate it to feed 5,000 people. Not only that, but there was also leftover food the next day. This is how much Jesus provided for people. Shortly after Jesus’s Resurrection, the bible says that Jesus’s followers, or disciples traveled throughout the Roman world telling about Jesus and his teachings. Theses disciples soon came the 12 disciples, or the Apostles. These people were the writers of the Gospels, and a man named Paul. 
	Paul is probably one of the most important figures in the spread of Christianity after Jesus’s death. He had never met Jesus face to face, although, he did the most spreading of Christianity ideals more than anyone else did. Paul was born a Jewish. At first, he didn’t like the sound of Jesus’s ideas. He always considered it a threat. Once he even tried to prevent the followers of Jesus from spreading their message. At a certain point Paul traveled to Damascus, and saw a blinding light, then he heard Jesus’s voice. From then on, he became a Christian. After he died Paul was named a saint. That is a person known and admired for his or her holiness.</p>

                <h1>Spread of Christianity</h1>
            
                <p>The very first Christians wanted to only spread the teachings of Jesus among Jews, and Jews only. Paul, along with other early Christians, wanted to spread it to non-Jews. This led to Christianity spreading to Rome. Then, a century after Jesus passed away, historians estimated that thousands of Christians lived in the Roman Empire. As Christianity spread, Christians began to write down parts of Jesus’s message, including the Gospels.They distributed copies of the Gospels and other writings to strengthen people’s faith. The Christians were trying to spread their beliefs, but the world didn’t make it easy. Some of the Christians were even arrested, and killed. This was because, the Christians refused to worship Rome’s gods. These people were called martyrs. The spread of the belief caused a punishing to the Christians called Persecution. This is a punishing to a group because of its beliefs or differences. Since now that the religion of the Christians were banned, they were forced to meet secretly. To arrange their meetings, the Christians would show their secret symbols. This was so they can identify people who shared their beliefs. According to page 393 of World History Ancient Civilization, the text states, “One of the most common symbols they used was a fish. This fish became a Christian symbol because the Greek word for fish begins with the same letter as the Greek words for Jesus and Christ.”
	Since the church largely had to meet in secret, it didn’t have any single leader to govern the church. Instead, of one leader to govern, there were bishops, that led each Christian community. The bishops not only did they lead, although they helped people understand and live by Christian teachings. One of the most important jobs for the bishops, was to lead the celebration of the Eucharist. This was created to honor the last supper Jesus shared with his Apostles. To remind Christians of Jesus during the Eucharist, they ate bread and drank wine. The most honored of all the empire’s empire’s bishops was the pope. According to page 394, the text states, “The word pope comes from the Greek word for father. The pope was so honored in the Christian world largely because Peter, the leader of the Apostles and a key figure in the early church, had been the first bishop of Rome. Later popes were seen as his spiritual successors.”
	As Christianity spread through the Roman world, Christian writers read the works of classical philosophers. One of the writers was Augustine of Hippo. Augustine studied the works of Plato. When he became a Christian, Augustine taught that Christians should focus not on worldly goods but on God’s plan for the world. His ideas helped shape Christian beliefs for hundreds of years. According to page 394, the text states, “At about the same time that Saint Augustine was writing, an even changed the standing of Christians in Rome. The emperor himself became a Christian.
