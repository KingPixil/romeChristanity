                <h1>Religion in the Roman Empire - S1</h1>
            
                <p>	The Romans were very religious people, and celebrated their religion beliefs, by holding many festivals in honor of their gods. Since the empire’s huge sized and diverse population, the nature of these festivals varied widely from place to place. The Romans were very practical people, and this practicality also extended into their lives. According to page 380, of the textbook, the text states, “The Romans didn’t think that they could be sure which gods did or did not exist.” In order to avoid any gods that were fake or did not exist, the Romans prayed to a wide range of gods and goddesses. A lot of the most popular gods in the Roman Empire were adopted from the conquered people by the Romans. Since the Romans liked the ideas about their religion the Romans, allowed people they conquered to keep their beliefs.
	According to page 381, the text states, “Roman leaders considered Judaism to be a potential problem for two reasons. One reason was religious, the other political. Both reason led to conflict between the Romans and the Jews of the empire.” The Jews did not worship many gods like the Romans, they believed that their God was the only god. Some of the Romans thought that the Jews were insulting or threatening Rome’s gods by not praising them, or praying to them. The Romans still let the Jews to keep their religion and still didn’t ban them. 
	A political conflict rose and started when the Jews rebelled against the Roman rule. Since this happened, Judea, the territory of where most the Jews  lived, was conquered by Rome in 63 BC. The Jews were very unhappy with the Roman rule. They wanted to be ruled with only Jews, not by outsiders. The resulted, with the Jews rebelling in the AD 60s. The rebellion was defeated and it failed, for this the Jews had been punished as well. The the early 100s the Jews rebelled once more against the Romans. According to page 382, the text states, “Tired of putting down Jewish revolts, the emperor Hadrian banned the practice of certain Jewish rituals.” Hadrian thought that this would put down the Jews, although he was mistaken. What he did was make the Jews even more angry, and one last time the Jews revolted again. Although, this time emperor Hadrian decided to end the rebellions in Jerusalem once and for all. The Romans army crushed the Jewish’ revolt, destroyed the Jewish capital of Jerusalem, and forced all Jews to leave the city. The emperor banned them from entering the city again, and the Jews moved into other parts of the world.</p>
